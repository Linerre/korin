* 15 Maps
** 15.3 Hashing
*** Determining the number of buckets
A small number of buckets is more likely to cause collision.

If N_{bucket} < N_{entries}, then collision is inevitable.


The concept of *load factor threshold* can be used as a common technique to dynamically resize a data structure so that its capacity enlarges properly before it has to.

Thumb of rule: load_factor (lambda) <= 0.7 leads to O(1) time complexity when looking up a key in a HashMap (pp.673).
